# CHE 181 ArduinoRTD
**Note - this code was developed and tested by Thomas Lee for the University of Waterloo CHE 181 - Design Studio 2 course with the direct permission of the course instructor to upload this code to Github**. 

This is a project in which an Arduino Uno R3 and an RTD (part no. [F2222-1000-A-100](https://www.omega.ca/en/search/?text=F2222-1000-A-100)) was used to determine the [cryoscopic constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryoscopic_constant) of a brine solution through the use of circuitry and thermal analysis.
Through setting a circuit in series and measuring the voltage drop across a known resistor, we are able to obtain the value of the freezing point depression of the solution. 
A full technical report was drafted in addition, following proper research documentation and IEEE referencing.
